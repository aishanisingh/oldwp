  <h2>About</h2>
      
  <p>I'm Aishani Singh, a freshman at The Harker School who's interested in STEM and in English. </p>
  
  <p>This is my website for pretty much anything, so look around if you're interested. To contact me, see <a href="/socials">Socials</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I also write a lot, so <a href="/essays">Essays</a> would be a pretty cool place to look at for my random thoughts and what not.</p>
  
  <p>I'm also passionate in social activism and politics, as those are natural interests that come over time when you're a debater (especially in Public Forum).</p>
  
  <p>Other than that, I consider myself to be a pretty chill person! Feel obliged to reach out to me over anything. </p>
  
  <br>
  
  <h2>Announcements? Updates? Blog?</h2>
  
  <p>Finally created a website! From scratch! React or Next.js would have been a better idea for a website that actually does something, but HTML does the trick. I do have a couple of things to post in <a href="/essays">Essays</a>, but I'm too lazy to do it right now.</p>
